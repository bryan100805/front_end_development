            <p>In SP, students in their second and third year can collaborate with external companies through <i>internship
                opportunities and projects collaborations</i>. My course, DAAA, even has an alternative path in second and third
                year, INC (INDUSTRY NOW CURRICULUM), in which students who thrive in their studies can choose this path and get to 
                <b>work as software developers at an industry-facing student agency</b> known as Project INC on real client industry
                projects to gain credits.
                All these opportunities, along with the knowledge gained from stuyding in SP, will open a lot of doors to
               <i> many career options</i>.</p>
