            <h3 class="headings"><u>A little history about me...</u></h3>
            <p>In Primary School, I was not really excited about studying but was more interested in sports related stuff.
                So, I will always play tag and soccer with my classmates and friends during recess and holidays. From Primary 1 to Primary 3, my CCA was <b>Chinese Orchestra</b>.
                I used to play the <i>ErHu and the Yang Qing</i>. Throughout that duration, I realised that this wasn't for me and it was also quite
                stressful trying to balance the practice hours and doing school work. Hence, in Primary 3, I changed my CCA to <b>Robotics Club</b>.
                I loved being able to build robots using the <i>EV3 set and MindStorms Software</i> to program the robots. In Primary 4 & 5,
                I even joined a few competitions like the <i>Sumo Robot Competition</i> in Science Centre. Even though I did not win any of them, it was still quite enjoyable
                and meaningful to me as I learnt a lot of things about robots and programming. <br><br>
                In Secondary School, my CCA was <b>Media Productions Team</b>. I joined the <b>Video</b> section of my CCA where I had to film videos during school events
                and edit them afterwards.
                I took on a leadership role of being the <i>Vice President of my CCA</i>. It was a lot of work as I had to prepare content for each session,
                 as well as conduct them, while preparing for examinations. Nonetheless, it taught me skills like presentation as well as planning for budget.

        <h2 class="headings"><u>FAQs:</u></h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Why did you choose studying in a Polytechnic over a JC?<br><br></dt>
            <dd>I realised that studying something based on <i>my interest</i> will give me the motivation I need to be
                resilient and push on to become better. Moreover, I prefer the Polytechnic <i>flexible studying hours</i>
                and the <i>numerous CCA choices</i> that I could pick. JC has fixed studying hours and the subjects topics
                are just too general. I have also realised that studying in Polytechnic will still allow me to <i>study
                in university in future</i>.<br><br></dd>
            <dt>Why have I chose to study in AI and Data Analytics Course?<br><br></dt>
            <dd>I wanted to gain a tech-based knowledge as the tech industry is always focusing on <i>breaking new grounds 
                to become much more developed</i>. I picked Artificial Intelligence as I am always interested in products
                 such as self-driving cars and Siri, therefore I wanted to learn how they work and how to program them.<br><br></dd>
            <dt>What kind of music do you like to listen to?<br><br></dt>
            <dd>I love to listen to all genres of music, but preferably pop music like Shawn Mendes and Lauv.<br><br></dd>
            <dt>Out of all the countries you have visited, which ones were your favourite?<br><br></dt>
            <dd>I love travelling to Japan and Australia. Food like sushi, shabu-shabu and ramen in Japan is delicious and I will
                never get tired of it, especially the service that comes with it. Driving on the road in Australia to visit the farms and 
                factories such as a Chocolate Factory just amazes me. That is the reason why I love road trips!</dd>
