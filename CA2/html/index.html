                <h3><u>A little history about me...</u></h3>
                <p>In Primary School, I was not really excited about studying but was more interested in sports related stuff.
                    So, I will always play tag and soccer with my classmates and friends during recess and holidays. From Primary 1 to Primary 3, my CCA was <mark>Chinese Orchestra</mark>.
                    I used to play the <i>ErHu and the Yang Qing</i>. Throughout that duration, I realised that this wasn't for me and it was also quite
                    stressful trying to balance the practice hours and doing school work. Hence, in Primary 3, I changed my CCA to <mark>Robotics Club</mark>.
                    I loved being able to build robots using the <i>EV3 set and MindStorms Software</i> to program the robots. In Primary 4 & 5,
                    I even joined a few competitions like the <i>Sumo Robot Competition</i> in Science Centre. Even though I did not win any of them, it was still quite enjoyable
                    and meaningful to me as I learnt a lot of things about robots and programming. <br><br>
                    In Secondary School, my CCA was <mark>Media Productions Team</mark>. I joined the <mark>Video</mark> section of my CCA where I had to film videos during school events
                    and edit them afterwards.
                    I took on a leadership role of being the <i>Vice President of my CCA</i>. It was a lot of work as I had to prepare content for each session,
                     as well as conduct them, while preparing for examinations. Nonetheless, it taught me skills like presentation as well as planning for budget.
