                <h2><u>My Experience in SP</u></h2>
                <p>
                    When I just started studying in SP, it was quite scary as it was a <i>completely new environment</i> for me.
                    My lecturers, my classmates, the classrooms and even the foodcourts were all different to me compared to in Secondary School. 
                    Workload in School of Computing was also very overwhelming. However, this quickly took a big turn 
                    as I managed to make a few friends in my class and also catch up in my studies. I even joined 2 CCAs, <mark>Muay
                    Thai</mark>, where I learnt different combat techniques, both attacking and defence, & my other cca, <mark>SPAI</mark> , where I
                    learn additional AI and programming skills and content to get me more familiar on the topic of AI. This allowed me to socialise
                    with people from other schools and different years in SP, like School of Engineering and School of Media, Arts and 
                    Design. I would say that SP offers a lot of food options across the campus, they have 6 food courts, 2 cafes and
                    even an Old Chang Kee food truck, which means that I will never run out of food choices to eat. One of the food court even
                    has a Starbucks. <br><br>
                    I would say one thing that stand out to me in SP compared to in secondary school is that <i>everything need to
                     be done independently</i>. For example, I need to keep track of all of my homework by myself, without any reminders from the teachers/lecturers.
